# MiControllerPluginForInputMapper
Code for the plugin, that can also be forked to create custom plugins for other controllers



It implements everything that a normal Xbox Controller does, but the gravity sensor is not available for now.

To use download inputMapper 2 from https://inputmapper.com, install and from within the applications install this plugin.

You'll also need the profiles plugin to save the mappings, the mapping plugin, and the scarlet 360 plugin (this emulates the xbox360 controller).
